some improvement I learned from searching online and building this app:

mongoose connection built, then server start listen
mongoose model class constructor requires collection singular name and schema
mongoose model object is a 'document', use save() to save to database
mongoose model class can find all data, query using find({}) 

docker container create a perfect develop env, no concern of local setup
nodemon docker runs great
create-react-app docker runs great

bash file build docker and run all in one command

swagger jsdoc apis reads files with swagger yaml api
swagger ui express has explore enabled looks better

I like seperate swagger doc, user info schema, routes in different files, very clean
